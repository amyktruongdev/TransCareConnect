      <h1>About TCC</h1>
      <p>We are a group of undergraduate UCLA students striving to mitigate the harm and fear faced by trans youth in
        their interactions with the medical system.</p>
      <img src="images/catsss.jpg">
      <p> We were inspired to create TransCareConnect [TCC] because we were
        challenged in our local hackathon to think about what we could do to distribute health equity.</p>
      <p>This was the original brainstorming process for the type of product we wanted to make.</p>

      <h2>TCC wanted to take the time to acknowledge all of QWERHacks, Fiona, Timid Robot, and Spencer for helping us
        through our journey
        of development!!!!</h2>
